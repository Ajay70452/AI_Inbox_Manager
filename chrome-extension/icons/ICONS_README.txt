Icons Required for Chrome Extension
=====================================

The extension needs the following icon sizes:

Required Sizes:
- icon16.png  (16x16px)  - Used in extension management page
- icon32.png  (32x32px)  - Used in Windows
- icon48.png  (48x48px)  - Used in extension management page
- icon128.png (128x128px) - Used in Chrome Web Store and installation

Design Guidelines:
- Use a simple, recognizable icon
- Suggested design: Email envelope with AI brain/circuit icon
- Use brand colors: Blue (#1a73e8) as primary
- Ensure icon is visible at all sizes
- PNG format with transparency
- Clear edges and good contrast

Temporary Solution:
Until custom icons are created, you can:
1. Use placeholder PNG files (solid color squares)
2. Generate icons using online tools
3. Hire a designer for professional icons

Tools for Creating Icons:
- Figma (design)
- Canva (quick creation)
- Adobe Illustrator (professional)
- Icon generators: https://icon.kitchen/

Note: The extension will still function without custom icons,
but Chrome will show a default gray icon instead.
