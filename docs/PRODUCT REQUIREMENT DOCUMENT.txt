AI Inbox Manager (Gmail & Outlook)
Version: 1.0 (Phase 1 MVP)
Owner: Ajay Raval
Product: AI-powered inbox automation for SMB teams
Platforms: Web App + Chrome Extension + Slack Integration

1. Product Overview
1.1 Summary
AI Inbox Manager is a SaaS tool built on top of Gmail and Outlook that adds an AI layer for SMB teams. It prioritizes emails, detects urgent sentiment, drafts replies, extracts tasks, and triggers alerts—without requiring users to leave their existing inbox.
The app turns unstructured email chaos into actionable workflows.

1.2 Target Users
Customer support teams
Sales teams
Operations teams

They want automation inside Gmail/Outlook.
